# Recruitment program for OpenX

The data structure I have implemented has assumptions:
- it has 2 arms and looks like an inverted V
- the right arm is always at most 2 edge lengths longer
- when we add a child, we start adding from the right child for the right edge, and for the left edge from the left child

I wrote my own tests for the program and tested it on my own data and those attached to the task
